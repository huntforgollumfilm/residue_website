                the end of July’s filming. It’s been the biggest roller
                coaster of a month. A huge learning experience for everyone
                involved. I think that there’s been a lot of stuff gone wrong
                this month. One of the best things about this project has been
                that it’s given young people starting out in this industry the
                chance to experience roles and responsibilities that we wouldn’t
                normally have the opportunity to do. Consequently a lot of what
                we were doing was trial and error: basically a huge learning
                curve. We’ve been fortunate enough to have had guidance from
                people who have been doing this for a long time. This advice has
                been invaluable, but I think it’s the mistakes we’ve made
                that have taught us the most. The general feeling towards
                filming in September is the plan to utilise all that we’ve
                learnt this month and put it into practise. It would have been a
                lot more productive I think if we’d shot the September stuff
                first, and then gone onto do the exterior shots afterwards. It
                would have benefited the actors to have filmed in sequence a bit
                more, and the difficult bits we would have been much more
                prepared for. However, set building wise this was the only way
                we could have scheduled the shoot. But that is something to bear
                in mind in the future. August should be used well now to be
                fully prepared for September, as well as give everyone a
                well-deserved rest! Greatly looking forward to everyone being
                back together again in September.</font></td>

                happy about parting with so much. Also, we needed to tow said
                crane all the way to the location in Halifax and did you know
                that NO cars nowadays are fitted with tow bars? Seriously, I’m
                talking two full days of trying to track one down – how crazy
                is that?!? Anyway, we found a suitable truck mounted crane that
                we could hire but micro budget over ruled our enthusiasm and we
                used a jib shot instead. Interested to see the scene once it’s
                had all the CGI done to it. Made for a brilliant last day of
                filming anyway. Up on a random hill looking out over the whole
                of Halifax (quite possibly the windiest place in Britain making
                jib functioning and our mini BBQ a bit of a challenge!)…but

                fit into the shoot today. Last night, Mike, Kate and Stoff spent
                hours being unsociable and planning it down to the last minute,
                but seriously - you can really tell the difference today. It
                really is worth doing the extra work despite the amount of time
                it takes. It’s been hard to be this precise this month due to
                the producers having so many areas of production to take care of
                than usual; but we’ve definitely leant the approach that is
                worth taking this month. We were back at the water tower today,
                a location we filmed at earlier in the month. We re-shot some
                scenes that we weren’t happy with and got the rest done. Had
                Jez and Kurt down a teeny hole with Damian the Creature for a
                good hour, which made for some hilarious behind the scenes
                footage. Then we moved to the woods and filmed the sequence with
                Wallace Abby and Caroline and a big attack. Cheated Caroline up
                a tree using foliage and the roof of a car, which was rather
                ingenious and, surprisingly, worked very well! Most of the cast
                and crew have finished for the month now, only minimal crew
                needed tomorrow.</font></td>

                locations featured in the trailer, which looked really creepy
                and was exactly what we needed. Kate and Stoff left in the
                afternoon to go secure a field above Halifax to film the final
                scene on Monday. The problem with York and the surrounding area
                is that it’s just way too flat. The city of Halifax is the
                ideal size for the shot that we want and it’s only an hour
                away. The owner of the field we wanted couldn’t have been more
                helpful, gave us access to his land with no worries at all and
                shared loads of info about the area that he thought we might
                find relevant. As the month is drawing to an end and today is
                Adrian’s birthday we had an early finish today and had a BBQ

                background. And kids screaming and feeding the ducks, which made
                sound recording a bit of a challenge as well. Oh for the luxury
                of closed sets. How cool would that be? However we got through
                eventually after some sneaky re-angling, and after 5pm most
                people disappeared and we could press on. We went on to film
                Caroline and the creature on the bridge. We ended up using the
                bigger, wider bridge rather than the smaller one. Managed to get
                the library roof location again to finish the sunset scenes. The
                reflection of the sunset in the windows behind Caroline, Wallace

                step and everyone was constantly harassed by hundreds of wasps

                very hot and we’re a little concerned that everyone is filming
                in direct, hot sun with no shelter for hours at a time. Working
                hard to keep everyone well hydrated and give them breaks
                regularly whilst still sticking to schedule. It’s not easy,
                but surprisingly the crew are mainly happy to just keep pressing

                the interior pod scenes in September, which will work in a
                similar way. It’s the little things that make a difference –
                the time that’s saved through storing equipment in the studio
                instead of in the office, having a base, not having to depend on
                weather, not constantly changing location, being able to light
                the scenes exactly how we like. These four days in the control
                room are a big chunk of the film, where the pod mates discover
                more about what’s going on, watch video diary footage,
                arguments arise, they see one of them die right in front of them
                etc. Because there’s so many important scenes being shot I
                think generally everyone feels as though we’re making a lot of

                had to put the safety of our actor first, which meant

                yet watched the footage back so unsure whether it looked ok, but
                a definite ten out of ten for effort on Ed’s part. Stoff and
                Kate then went to meet Jaimie, the production designer, and help
                her turn the small YSTV television studio we’re using into the

                stunts go we’re not exactly experienced so it should
                definitely be an interesting day… We all quite enjoyed
                climbing trees for a few hours however as we worked out how best
                to do it. Also came across the most fascinating box half buried
                beneath our tree of choice full of half suicidal German love
                letters. Forget <i>The Hunt For Gollum:</i> there’s a romantic

                Chris benefited well from getting away from directing for a few
                hours and doing some basic location stills and idea developing
                in the woods. He seemed a lot calmer and happier by the end of

                as opposed to the characters and dialogue as usual. This is the

                grabbing etc. The guy who let us in there was really obliging,

                have any success. Feel a bit disheartened, almost like a wasted
                afternoon, but we have ruled out York as a location for the
                final scene. We’ll have to go further afield. This evening we

                team effort. I love that, it makes it so much more pleasurable
                in the long run and alleviates pressures all round.</font></td>

                telephone interview for the BBC website recently and brought a
                copy in this morning. As far as P+P goes it’s fantastic. The
                project came across very well. Arin arrived today at lunchtime,
                much better, thankfully. Now things can really get going. We
                also discovered an HD screen in one of the rooms we’ve been
                using and got to watch some footage on it. Wow…it just look so
                impressive, can’t believe what a different HD makes. Another
                security hasslement today involving one of them getting on his
                high horse and being not too nice. Sorted everything out pretty
                quickly with a phonecall to the security centre and he went on
                his way but we weren’t happy. He was really horrible,
                honestly, some people just don’t get that we’re trying to do
                something decent here. Pleh.</font></td>

                everything is much more relaxed. The actors seem happy with what
                we produced last night, and we heard from Arin – he is due to
                arrive tomorrow morning. This should hopefully get things back
                on track again. The problem we’ve now had to deal with is
                losing our production office, which we were lucky to have in the
                first place. We had strict instructions regarding what we could
                and couldn’t do in there, which we were keen to abide by. It
                irritates me when you follow rules and get in trouble anyway -
                why bother?! We have to find another production office really
                quickly; we’re a bit nomadic at the moment. Skilly had a
                make-up test and looked ok, but not exactly what we had in mind.
                We shot Damian’s death scene whilst we had a creature ready,
                although this will need re-shooting at a later date. Took Kate
                and Stoff forever to clean up the fake blood we’d chucked all
                over the wall. Think a cleaning programme should be talked
                about. We’re gonna go right off Golden Syrup before the Summer’s

                unfortunately, but this cannot be helped. The actors rehearsed
                with the director all morning and we filmed some of the
                improvisation. We have a sneaky suspicion that we’re going to
                get hassled a lot by security as the month wears on. Had our
                first encounter today whilst filming this afternoon, which took
                a great deal of explaining and permission proving but was worked

                Matt, playing Damian, spent the entire morning having a mould
                made of his arm and upper torso for use in his death scene.
                Though he said it was uncomfortable and his arm must have ached
                like hell, he was still stroked and plastered by the girls for a
                couple of hours. Which I think he secretly enjoyed. Finding it
                quite interesting helping with all these cheap attempts at
                effects – who says you need millions? It’s all about
                creativity. We also had a great laugh at Chris’ expense when
                he volunteered to test the tooth enamel Robin got to use on Rach
                and ended up with just one insanely white tooth and was too
                scared to smile for the rest of the day for fear of being
                laughed at. Spirits are quite high and the work with the actors
