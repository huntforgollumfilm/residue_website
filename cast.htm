At the age of 16, he cast her as 'Belinda' in his first film project "False Keys". The rest, as they say, is history. Ivania graduated from "Urdang Academy of Ballet" in 1994, but gave up a professional dance career in 99 due to severe injuries. Since then, she's dedicated her time to acting & has worked on numerous shorts & features. For more information check <a href="http://www.ivaniaelena.com/">her website</a>.</p>
