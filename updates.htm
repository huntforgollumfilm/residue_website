<h4><span>About the project</span> </h4>

			
<p>Human Residue is a survival movie concept from indie filmmaker Chris
Bouchard which he developed with collaborator Mike Ritchie and Rickety
Shack Films into a&nbsp;film-making project with a crew of over fifty
participants in York, UK in 2006 and resulting in the movies, trailers
and clips on this website. Since then Chris has gone on to make the
Lord of the Rings fan film sensation: <a href="http://www.thehuntforgollum.com" target="_blank">The Hunt For Gollum</a>. He hopes to gain funding to continue the Residue saga.<br />
</p>
<h4><span>22 May 2008</span> New Phase of Residue Production </h4>

			
<p>We are in talks with a new producer to take the vision of Human
Residue forwards as a new fresh project. As such we are looking for
private investors to complete the film however we are still intending a
free online release of Human Residue, for a limited period.&nbsp; </p>



                               	  
<h4><span>07 Sept 2007</span> Production Update &amp; New Teaser</h4>

			
<p> A little update on our progress. We've filmed some very nice
pickups and new scenes in early April, mid May and mid June. Including
part of the final action scene at an abandoned aircraft hangar in north
Yorkshire (great location) which went very well indeed. We're now
trying to schedule upcoming shoots to fit the restructured edit/script.
Since our editor Jonny Ellins got back from his travels, he's made
further progress in the editing. We've also been working on a behind
the scenes featurette showing The Story So Far on the production.
Onwards we march towards completion...</p>


                             
<p> Also we've completed a <b>new teaser</b> which you can watch <a href="trailers/ResidueTease-who.will.survive_hi.wmv" target="_blank">here. (WMV)</a>
                         </p>


		       	
<h4><span>11 May 2007</span> Residue Release Dates...</h4>

			
<p>We have to admit that the film has got a little behind schedule. The
fact is making a feature with no money takes a huge amount of effort.
Nevertheless we're working hard on it everyday, editing, shooting
pickups and some new scenes over the coming weeks and it's still a very
exciting time for the production. Current estimates are that the film
will take another few months to complete depending when we can schedule
the remaining shoots around our locations and the busy schedules of the
team! As soon as we've scheduled those shoots (this week hopefully
we'll be announcing the projected release date of the film. </p>




                   	
<h4><span>07 May 2007</span> Recent Shoots...</h4>

			
<p> Recently we had a very successful 2 days of shooting in early
April, getting 2 brand new scenes and montage shots for the opening
sequence. This weekend we just spent two days shooting more G.V.s
(General Views) which means POV landscape shots with no actors - a very
nice post apocalyp-plectic sunset actually!! Anyway the new trailer has
been awaiting some dialogue recording sessions with the actors (want to
perfect the production values) so that will be coming soon I promise.
Instead we're going to release a shorter teaser clip in the meantime. </p>
