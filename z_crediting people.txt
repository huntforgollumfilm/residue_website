Hi Chris,

I am in the US at present and have not had a chance to look at your budget. I hope to in the next few days.  As for the synopsis, sure, send it and I will give you my honest feedback.

The website looks good.  As for including Media, that is a bit of a tricky issue.  The link that you presently have is for an entity that doesn't exist any more (the Media Engineering Group in Electronics was absorbed into the Intelligent Systems Group so it technically no longer exists). So, you should not use the link you presently have.  There is not yet a site for the new Department of Theatre, Film & TV so you cannot link to it.  And, unless the University has explicitly endorsed your project, you probably should not make direct reference to it.  All of that said...

Basically people/entities who are helping you (like me, Richard Woolley, Damian, etc.) fall into three categories:  1) those who merit a 'Special Thanks' credit, 2) those who are 'Production Consultants' and 3) those who are 'Executive Producers'.  At this stage the University would fit in category 1) for access to kit and facilities, and I would likely fit in 2) given our technical and procedural talks. I don't know how much Damian and Richard have assisted but I expect they would be 1) or 2) at this stage. If someone were to get more deeply involved with promotion, contacts, overall guidance, etc., that could fall under 3) but it would have to be a very substantial contribution.  All of these credits should be included on both the website and in the tail credits of the finished film.  Remember, filmmaking is about relationships.  Even though you cannot pay folks you can reward their assistance with credits.

Hope this helps.  I look forward to seeing the synopsis.

Regards,
John
